1. Run getObstaclePosition with the VREP model file to get the obstacles positions.
2. Feed these obstacle positions into differentialDriveAstar.m file in the obstaclePosition1-6 variables
3. Make the same changes in the outObstacles.m file
4. Run differentialDriveAstarTest.m with the obstaclePositions set.
5. save the wheel Velocities generated as pathValues.mat.
6. Run simulationInVREP.m file with the VREP model project3.ttt running.
